## Background Study
To make this project we did some study on the diseases which we included in our website

The diseases are :-

**ADHD** -  or Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, is a neuro developmental disorder that affects both children and adults. It is characterized by persistent patterns of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity that can interfere with daily functioning and quality of life.

**Anxiety** - Anxiety is a natural response to stress and a normal part of life. However, when anxiety becomes excessive, persistent, and interferes with daily functioning, it may be indicative of an anxiety disorder. Anxiety disorders are a group of mental health conditions characterized by intense, excessive, and persistent worry and fear about everyday situations.

**OCD** - Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a mental health condition characterized by persistent, intrusive thoughts (obsessions) and repetitive behaviors or mental acts (compulsions) performed in response to the obsessions. OCD can significantly interfere with daily life and can cause considerable distress

**Bipolar Disorder** - Bipolar disorder, formerly known as manic-depressive illness, is a mental health condition characterized by extreme mood swings or episodes of mania and depression. Individuals with bipolar disorder may experience periods of intense emotional highs (mania or hypomania) followed by periods of deep sadness or hopelessness (depression). The severity, duration, and frequency of these mood episodes can vary.

**Depression** - Depression, or major depressive disorder, is a common and serious mental health condition characterized by persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and a lack of interest or pleasure in daily activities. Depression affects how a person thinks, feels, and handles daily activities, and it can lead to various emotional and physical problems.<br>
